Token Mill markets has two multiple fee types.

This is not inclusive of the spread, which is in effect, also a fee.

Fees are independently set by the Token Mill and Token Owner.

Expectation is that spread will be significantly higher than the orderbook trading fee, to allow for low cost P2P trading.

The auction fee will only be charged at TGE and replaces both the supply curve and trading fee normally incurred.

## Trading Fee

A flat trading fee is charged on all order fills. The rate is equal for both buys & sells and only available to the Token Mill.

- Fee collected in Quote token. Available to Mill only.

## Auction Fee

A fee may be charged by the Token Mill for hosting the token launch. This fee is charged instead of other fees.
